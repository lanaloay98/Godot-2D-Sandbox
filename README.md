Godot 2D Sandbox

A lightweight 2D sandbox simulation built with Godot Engine, focusing on physics-based interactions between water, sand, and rocks.
The project demonstrates basic particle mechanics and efficient 2D rendering for interactive simulations.

🔹 Features

🌊 Water simulation with gravity and fluid-like movement.

🏖️ Sand particles that sink in water and pile naturally.

🪨 Rocks that block water and sand flow.

⚡ Real-time interactions between materials (sinking, containment, and stacking).

🔹 Controls

Add particles (water, sand, rock) directly into the simulation.

Watch how particles react to gravity and collisions in real time.

🔹 Tech Stack

Godot Engine (2D)

GDScript

Basic 2D Physics & Particle Simulation

🔹 Future Improvements

🧪 Add fire, oil, and flammable interactions.

🌬️ Introduce wind or external forces.

🎮 UI for easier selection of particle types.

🔹 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/lanaloay98/godot-2d-sandbox.git


Open the project in Godot Engine.

Run the main scene to start the simulation.

⚡ This project was created as part of my learning journey in game development and physics simulations with Godot.
