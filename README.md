A lightweight 2D sandbox simulation built with Godot Engine, focusing on physics-based interactions between water, sand, and rocks.
The project demonstrates basic particle mechanics and efficient 2D rendering for interactive simulations.

🔹 Features

🌊 Water simulation with gravity and fluid-like movement.

🏖️ Sand particles that sink in water and pile naturally.

🪨 Rocks that block water and sand flow.

⚡ Real-time interactions between materials (sinking, containment, and stacking).

🔹 Controls

Add/delete particles (water, sand, rock) directly into the simulation.

Watch how particles react to gravity and collisions in real time.
